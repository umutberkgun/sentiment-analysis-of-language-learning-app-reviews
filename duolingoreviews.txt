1) This is an amazing game for educating people in languages including almost extinct ones (I think that's super cool)! The only problem I've ever had is that it has kicked me out for a couple days and I've lost my streak because of it. Otherwise I love this app!

2) The memes are wrong he will just leave you alone if you don't open it for a while he is not evil he can help you learn languages faster than schools but probably keep your steak up it says something like watch out but other than all of that it is great

3) I did my Spanish lessons please give me my family back

4) Over 20 years ago, I lived in Italy for 4 years (not consecutive) and had several group lessons but despite the efforts of my various instructors, I just didn't have the patience to learn the grammar. My knowledge of vocabulary was good enough for me to communicate and function but I never could get the hang of conjugating verbs, learning about the articles, and spelling words properly. Later lived in Latin America for 4 years and that messed up my language skills big time! So, now I speak both languages very poorly - just throwing out words to make a mishmash sentence. A couple years ago I went back to Italy and they asked me if I could speak english because they couldn't tell if I spoke Spanish, Italian or some unknown language! (Note: My native language is American English)

So, I'm returning to Italy again for a 2 week vacation and I'm determined to be better this time and not embarrass myself. So, I got Duolingo on Feb 20th and believe it or not, I'm truly addicted to the program! I have a full time job and when I come home I'm tired and yet, every single day, I spend 1 hour to 2 hours working on these mini lessons from Duolingo! Funny, they are kind of addictive. They force you to learn the language by making you hear the language, speak the language, interpret the phrase back and forth between languages, to spell it properly, and put it in the correct order. If you do it wrong more than 3x then, it kicks you out of the lesson and makes you start over, but the lesson is different the next time around. Now, you would think one would get discouraged, I mean, I've had to redo some lessons about 6x, and yet, somehow, the way it is structured, it makes me want to keep at it and do it right! I mean it is working on me, one of the most stubborn learners!

So there are a multitude of topics at every level (beginning/intermediate/advanced) and within each topic they have 4-8 different minilessons in each topic. It visually has a graph that shows you where you are at. And, even when you think you are done with a topic (whew), every couple of days, that topic reopens and they make you practice it again so you don't forget! Wow! So, even with my background knowledge/vocabulary of Italian, I'm still at the very end of the beginners (Level 8; 335 words!) and I've been working hard for a month! Oh, another downer is I was working on it for 12 days and suddenly it reset and told me I was back on day 1. I thought it did that every 12 days but now it says I'm at 16 days. (IF ANYONE READS THIS FROM DUOLINGO; I WANT IT RESET TO FEB 20TH THAT I'VE DONE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!).

The downside is that if you have never ever studied a latin language this would be super hard for you. I think if you already know a similar language like spanish and how it is structured, it will be easier for you. However, if you are a person who has never studied a romance language and absolute beginner that only knows Ciao, etc..and hever had a lesson, then, you will have a hard time. Also, if you are a miserable speller in your native language, learning to spell Italian will kill you because it is so difficult to get all of the vowels in the right place. I have many times translated a very complicated sentence from english to Italian, only to get it counted wrong cuz I misspelled 1 letter! But, it forces me to really think what I'm writing and how it all comes together to form a complete sentence. Also, it really doesn't teach you the vocabulary or the grammar rules, at all. I kept failing the lesson because I wasn't sure what some articles meant because they seem to mean different things at different times. Yesterday, I finally broke down and got a grammar book so I can look up what all of the articles mean. So, this program works for people who are already familiar. I'm worried that when I get in the more immediate level, I might need to study before using this as it isn't really a good teacher - doesn't explain or introduce new concepts. Good for people that really want to tighten up what they already know and go farther.

5) Duolingo is a great program. I have been learning with it for just over two years now (I upgraded to the Pro version) and by studying at home, with just Duolingo, I am now able to read some Spanish novels, read some magazines and newspapers, and I have a general understanding of the language.

But ... if you really want to converse with others, you will need more than this to do that. When I listen to Spanish TV or music or a movie, I"m lost. I have Spanish speaking friends and if they speak slowly, I will understand but in order to respond, it will take me too much time to think about how to properly frame the response. If I were asked to write down my response, I could do that more easily than speaking.

My point is, this is an excellent program and I enjoy using it and feel accomplished. But, to truly learn the language, you will need interaction with others who are fluent in the language.

Let this get you started and, if you find yourself enjoying it, get a tutor, take a Spanish class, or travel and do some immersion learning. As you're taking lessons, Duolingo will help along the way.

Great things about DuoLingo -
** It has an active discussion group, so if you're confused about an answer, just click and you'll likely see 100's of posts about that issue.
** It has a dictionary so that you can find words that are not part of your lesson
** As you learn words, it adds them to your personal word list and shows you when you last used that word so that you can practice vocabulary that you might have not used in a while.
** You can read stories that are based on your reading level; it is not just grammar.
** The Android version is very easy but I prefer to use it on my laptop or Kindle. Fortunately, Duolingo has platforms for all as well as iOS.
** It lets you set your own pace and will remind you daily if you've met your goal for the day. You can change the time you spend per day whenever you like.
** Duolingo has a podcast as well which is good to practice your listening skills. It may be too advanced, but it's still good to help you learn the flow and tone of the language.

I deducted one star because many people will think this IS the answer, when in fact it is only a part of the answer. The program also has a bit of trouble with voice recognition but then, it might be that my Brooklyn accent does not translate well into proper Spanish.

6) I know that they had added duolingo push I know that they had added duolingo push IT was when was when Duo comes to your house or Wherever you are But I think they fired that guy I don't know so I have a kindle I don't think the Duo gonna come to my house! When I was Not playing Duolingo well he didn't come to my house Yay Very fun ( I wish he came to my house) So yeah 5 stars! Do you have streak Duolingo!

7) I love this app and all the languages that you can choose from but I have been wanting to learn Bosnian so I can speak it to my friends that speak it but I can't but otherwise love it.

8) I studied French in high school and college years ago, and I've picked up a bit of Spanish here and there, and by reading some of the Bible in Spanish. I decided to pick up some German with Duolingo because I have a nephew who studied that. Well, that started out so well I decided to brush up my French and see what I could do with Spanish. Probably not a good idea to work on three languages at once, but I'm enjoying it and making progress. I was so rusty on French my attempt to test out of the Basics failed (just barely), but it's nice to know the option is there if you don't want to review from the beginning. Repetition is an important part of learning any language, but it can get boring. This program solves the problem by mixing up the styles of questions. It starts out very easy - some of the questions are as easy as tapping the picture of the word given in your native language with the target language below it. On some questions, you can tap the given word and see its translation, so you don't have to guess even if it is a new word (but guessing can be fun and doesn't "hurt" much!). Pay attention to the little words that go with them, though! In English (which is hard to learn in other ways) we just have "the" for everything, but in French and Spanish you have variations to match the gender and number of the objects (German has three singular forms, one being neuter, I guess). How do you know if an object takes a masculine (le or el) or feminine (la)? Practice, practice, practice! Take your time and think and memorize, and write words and combinations down. And Duolingo does let you go back and review skill sets. The instant feedback is much more enjoyable than doing written homework, but the German is making me want to get a textbook and do some extra studying! Some questions let you translate phrases or sentences by selecting from a choice of words, others let you listen to spoken words, phrases, or sentences and then select the words you hear. More challenging questions require you to type in the translation or words from memory. It even has voice recognition so some questions require you to repeat things in the target language. If it doesn't recognize what you say, it doesn't count it against you (lots of things can go wrong with voice recognition, such as background noises). If you can't get away from the noise or otherwise can't or don't want to use your microphone, you can turn off that feature and it will only give you the other kinds of questions. I've noticed that it also gives some leeway for typographical errors, although sometimes it's still counted typos as wrong and other times I've just been wrong but it was counted as a typo. It generally gets it right and the two kinds of errors balance out. I've typed in a translation when the task was to type out what was spoken in the foreign language, and it gave me a do-over. But watch out, if you make a mistake in your own language, it will count that wrong, too! English speakers had better know how to properly use "to," "too," and "two," for example. Or maybe using DuoLingo will help you with that, too! Daily e-mail reminders (which can be turned off) help you to stick to it.

[ADDED LATER] Well, I'm up to Level 5 in all three languages, and I'm definitely feeling the pinch of trying to make it QuadLingo. As I fail lessons, though, previous skills re-open to show where I need to go back and practice more, which is a good thing. It's exciting to be learning these languages, and I'm thinking I might dig through my collection of language texts to add to and aid my DuoLingo studies, since I've gone and set myself a three-pronged challenge. I wish I'd thought of taking notes earlier (I just added that bit with this edit); I'm sure that would be enough to make studying one language a cinch with DuoLingo.

9) Guy's duo in not evil soooo pis not uninstall pis duo is nice and a
good app
This is nice

If you can't get away from the noise or otherwise can't or don't want to use your microphone, you can turn off that feature and it will only give you the other kinds of questions. I've noticed that it also gives some leeway for typographical errors, although sometimes it's still counted typos as wrong and other times I've just been wrong but it was counted as a typo. It generally gets it right and the two kinds of errors balance out. I've typed in a translation when the task was to type out what was spoken in the foreign language, and it gave me a do-over. But watch out, if you make a mistake in your own language, it will count that wrong, too! English speakers had better know how to properly use "to," "too," and "two," for example. Or maybe using DuoLingo will help you with that, too! Daily e-mail reminders (which can be turned off) help you to stick to it.

[ADDED LATER] Well, I'm up to Level 5 in all three languages, and I'm definitely feeling the pinch of trying to make it QuadLingo. As I fail lessons, though, previous skills re-open to show where I need to go back and practice more, which is a good thing. It's exciting to be learning these languages, and I'm thinking I might dig through my collection of language texts to add to and aid my DuoLingo studies, since I've gone and set myself a three-pronged challenge. I wish I'd thought of taking notes earlier (I just added that bit with this edit); I'm sure that would be enough to make studying one language a cinch with DuoLingo.

29) Guy's duo in not evil soooo pis not uninstall pis duo is nice and a
good app
This is nice

e

30) Its great but....duolingo WILL find you,kill you,Make it look like a accident, Cry at your funeral, And have people feel bad for you if you miss your daily streak.... So don't miss and you'll be fine!!😍😍

31) This is an amazing game for educating people in languages including almost extinct ones (I think that's super cool)! The only problem I've ever had is that it has kicked me out for a couple days and I've lost my streak because of it. Otherwise I love this app!

32) The memes are wrong he will just leave you alone if you don't open it for a while he is not evil he can help you learn languages faster than schools but probably keep your steak up it says something like watch out but other than all of that it is great

33) I did my Spanish lessons please give me my family back

34) Over 20 years ago, I lived in Italy for 4 years (not consecutive) and had several group lessons but despite the efforts of my various instructors, I just didn't have the patience to learn the grammar. My knowledge of vocabulary was good enough for me to communicate and function but I never could get the hang of conjugating verbs, learning about the articles, and spelling words properly. Later lived in Latin America for 4 years and that messed up my language skills big time! So, now I speak both languages very poorly - just throwing out words to make a mishmash sentence. A couple years ago I went back to Italy and they asked me if I could speak english because they couldn't tell if I spoke Spanish, Italian or some unknown language! (Note: My native language is American English)

So, I'm returning to Italy again for a 2 week vacation and I'm determined to be better this time and not embarrass myself. So, I got Duolingo on Feb 20th and believe it or not, I'm truly addicted to the program! I have a full time job and when I come home I'm tired and yet, every single day, I spend 1 hour to 2 hours working on these mini lessons from Duolingo! Funny, they are kind of addictive. They force you to learn the language by making you hear the language, speak the language, interpret the phrase back and forth between languages, to spell it properly, and put it in the correct order. If you do it wrong more than 3x then, it kicks you out of the lesson and makes you start over, but the lesson is different the next time around. Now, you would think one would get discouraged, I mean, I've had to redo some lessons about 6x, and yet, somehow, the way it is structured, it makes me want to keep at it and do it right! I mean it is working on me, one of the most stubborn learners!

So there are a multitude of topics at every level (beginning/intermediate/advanced) and within each topic they have 4-8 different minilessons in each topic. It visually has a graph that shows you where you are at. And, even when you think you are done with a topic (whew), every couple of days, that topic reopens and they make you practice it again so you don't forget! Wow! So, even with my background knowledge/vocabulary of Italian, I'm still at the very end of the beginners (Level 8; 335 words!) and I've been working hard for a month! Oh, another downer is I was working on it for 12 days and suddenly it reset and told me I was back on day 1. I thought it did that every 12 days but now it says I'm at 16 days. (IF ANYONE READS THIS FROM DUOLINGO; I WANT IT RESET TO FEB 20TH THAT I'VE DONE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!).

The downside is that if you have never ever studied a latin language this would be super hard for you. I think if you already know a similar language like spanish and how it is structured, it will be easier for you. However, if you are a person who has never studied a romance language and absolute beginner that only knows Ciao, etc..and hever had a lesson, then, you will have a hard time. Also, if you are a miserable speller in your native language, learning to spell Italian will kill you because it is so difficult to get all of the vowels in the right place. I have many times translated a very complicated sentence from english to Italian, only to get it counted wrong cuz I misspelled 1 letter! But, it forces me to really think what I'm writing and how it all comes together to form a complete sentence. Also, it really doesn't teach you the vocabulary or the grammar rules, at all. I kept failing the lesson because I wasn't sure what some articles meant because they seem to mean different things at different times. Yesterday, I finally broke down and got a grammar book so I can look up what all of the articles mean. So, this program works for people who are already familiar. I'm worried that when I get in the more immediate level, I might need to study before using this as it isn't really a good teacher - doesn't explain or introduce new concepts. Good for people that really want to tighten up what they already know and go farther.

35) Duolingo is a great program. I have been learning with it for just over two years now (I upgraded to the Pro version) and by studying at home, with just Duolingo, I am now able to read some Spanish novels, read some magazines and newspapers, and I have a general understanding of the language.

But ... if you really want to converse with others, you will need more than this to do that. When I listen to Spanish TV or music or a movie, I"m lost. I have Spanish speaking friends and if they speak slowly, I will understand but in order to respond, it will take me too much time to think about how to properly frame the response. If I were asked to write down my response, I could do that more easily than speaking.

My point is, this is an excellent program and I enjoy using it and feel accomplished. But, to truly learn the language, you will need interaction with others who are fluent in the language.

Let this get you started and, if you find yourself enjoying it, get a tutor, take a Spanish class, or travel and do some immersion learning. As you're taking lessons, Duolingo will help along the way.

Great things about DuoLingo -
** It has an active discussion group, so if you're confused about an answer, just click and you'll likely see 100's of posts about that issue.
** It has a dictionary so that you can find words that are not part of your lesson
** As you learn words, it adds them to your personal word list and shows you when you last used that word so that you can practice vocabulary that you might have not used in a while.
** You can read stories that are based on your reading level; it is not just grammar.
** The Android version is very easy but I prefer to use it on my laptop or Kindle. Fortunately, Duolingo has platforms for all as well as iOS.
** It lets you set your own pace and will remind you daily if you've met your goal for the day. You can change the time you spend per day whenever you like.
** Duolingo has a podcast as well which is good to practice your listening skills. It may be too advanced, but it's still good to help you learn the flow and tone of the language.

I deducted one star because many people will think this IS the answer, when in fact it is only a part of the answer. The program also has a bit of trouble with voice recognition but then, it might be that my Brooklyn accent does not translate well into proper Spanish.

36) I know that they had added duolingo push I know that they had added duolingo push IT was when was when Duo comes to your house or Wherever you are But I think they fired that guy I don't know so I have a kindle I don't think the Duo gonna come to my house! When I was Not playing Duolingo well he didn't come to my house Yay Very fun ( I wish he came to my house) So yeah 5 stars! Do you have streak Duolingo!

37) I love this app and all the languages that you can choose from but I have been wanting to learn Bosnian so I can speak it to my friends that speak it but I can't but otherwise love it.

38) I studied French in high school and college years ago, and I've picked up a bit of Spanish here and there, and by reading some of the Bible in Spanish. I decided to pick up some German with Duolingo because I have a nephew who studied that. Well, that started out so well I decided to brush up my French and see what I could do with Spanish. Probably not a good idea to work on three languages at once, but I'm enjoying it and making progress. I was so rusty on French my attempt to test out of the Basics failed (just barely), but it's nice to know the option is there if you don't want to review from the beginning. Repetition is an important part of learning any language, but it can get boring. This program solves the problem by mixing up the styles of questions. It starts out very easy - some of the questions are as easy as tapping the picture of the word given in your native language with the target language below it. On some questions, you can tap the given word and see its translation, so you don't have to guess even if it is a new word (but guessing can be fun and doesn't "hurt" much!). Pay attention to the little words that go with them, though! In English (which is hard to learn in other ways) we just have "the" for everything, but in French and Spanish you have variations to match the gender and number of the objects (German has three singular forms, one being neuter, I guess). How do you know if an object takes a masculine (le or el) or feminine (la)? Practice, practice, practice! Take your time and think and memorize, and write words and combinations down. And Duolingo does let you go back and review skill sets. The instant feedback is much more enjoyable than doing written homework, but the German is making me want to get a textbook and do some extra studying! Some questions let you translate phrases or sentences by selecting from a choice of words, others let you listen to spoken words, phrases, or sentences and then select the words you hear. More challenging questions require you to type in the translation or words from memory. It even has voice recognition so some questions require you to repeat things in the target language. If it doesn't recognize what you say, it doesn't count it against you (lots of things can go wrong with voice recognition, such as background noises). If you can't get away from the noise or otherwise can't or don't want to use your microphone, you can turn off that feature and it will only give you the other kinds of questions.
