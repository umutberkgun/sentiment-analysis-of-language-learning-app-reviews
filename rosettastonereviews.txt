1) I used the cd version when I was a kid, and when I took foreign language classes in high school and college it was a breeze.
I got this online version for my kid and she speeds through the lessons quickly. Already to the point where she can interpret some sentences that she hears spoken.

2) I saw a bunch of reviews saying that they didn't get the right product, or they have to pay the monthly fee. I want to say that this is not the case. It is for each language, and is truly a lifetime product. I can switch languages at any time, and not once have been charged or asked to pay any fee.

For the product itself, it is really good. You get plenty of languages, and it speaks very clearly for you. I've only tested a couple, so for other languages I'm unfamiliar with, I cannot say how clear it is for each language. They have photos and go over words many times, sentences many times, in each session. Sure it can get repetitive, but how else can you actually learn a language?

I haven't gotten far enough to see if there may be an option to speak with as a partner, whether verbal or typing. If that is an option, I might need to bump this up another star.

I dropped one star for one reason only. They start lessons in an odd way. Not bad, just odd. You NEED to have a slight understanding of the language you want to learn first. I started with Korean, and I only heard Korean. I only saw Korean. Now it wasn't trying to learn conversations right away. It was basic words, like man, woman, walk, sit, etc. However, they should use English (or your native language) and when you select an option, say it in Korean, or have it written in English. Or they could teach you the alphabet first, so you can read the words as they are spoken.

Overall, it is 100% worth the price to me. You get 24 (maybe 25?) languages, for an unlimited time. So even though the product starts as if you know the basics of the languages, you have plenty of time to learn. It can still be improved, but the earlier you start, the better it is for you as well.

3) For those struggling with the code, do a quick Google search on activing a code on Rosetta Stone. Add the same email you created your account with, and reload the site/app. It's an extra step, but it does work to give you access to 24 languages on one account, across any platform you choose.

I've seen some other reviews mentioning that it's hard to get into the language unless you have a basis- this is an IMMERSIVE learning program. They will never speak to you in your native language, and that's a good thing. That makes it easier for you to skip translating in your head. You see a picture of an apple, hear "manzana," and then choose an apple picture when you hear that word again. It's better for learning to skip the English (or your first language) and to associate that word with the concept directly.

So far, my only complaint is that I've learned some dialectal differences (I started at intermediate in one language) and sometimes it doesn't pick up my accent unless I enunciate in exactly the way it wants. I also wish it could slow down the sentences/word so that I could hear it properly- they speak clearly, but there is no way to get the program to "spell it out" unless the language you chose has an writing system you're perfect in.

4) Who hasn't heard of Rosetta Stone? I've always thought of them as the top brand for self-taught language courses. I don't think that now.

SUMMARY:
- Should not be primary, much less only tool
- Bad user experience online
- Useless phone app
- Decent speech recognition online
- Great for grammar
- Great practice typing (online version)
- Not sure that it's worth $200

FULL REVIEW
It's cool to think that you'll be able to learn 25 languages, but seriously.... You'll only have time to learn one well, at a time. And, at the slow pace that the lessons proceed, you'll spend 1 - 3 years learning the basics (vocab, grammar, etc).

But, one thing to take into account, is that this IS NOT for strict beginners. If you've never had a basic course in your target language, it will be hard to understand what to do, and how to respond.

This brings up a question of, "what is your end goal?"
- Are you looking to learn simple phrases you can use for an upcoming trip?
- Is this to supplement high school or college courses?
- Are you wanting to learn just enough to say a few phrases with friends or if you meet a native speaker?
- Or, are you like me, looking to become fluent?

I do agree in the "immersive" approach that Rosetta Stone takes. I, however, disagree with the way they implement it. No matter how much of an immersive experience, you usually have someone who can help explain any questions you might have.
- a child has adults
- when I got thrown into 3rd grade without knowing a word of English, there were kids my age patient enough to help me understand/learn/communicate

And that's something that this course is missing.

For these reasons, this should not be your primary tool for learning another language (slow pace, not for beginners, no help).

In addition, the web interface lacks functionality. Some lessons have a nice way to go back to lesson plan/path while others do not, forcing you to go back to 'Home'.

The phone app is notching more than flash cards. And the last straw was this morning when it sent me a message telling me to brush up on my Spanish (a language I've never even clicked on in app or site).

I find myself using Duolingo a lot more than Rosetta Stone. It encourages me because they've gamefied the experience but they've also done a fantastic job with their interface (online and on mobile).

Rosetta Stone's audio companion files have proven useless for me. The on-demand videos have some value in explaining local customs and slang, but not really all that useful. They should have turned these subjects into actual courses, instead.

WHAT DO I LIKE ABOUT ROSETTA STONE?
It complements Duolingo by navigating a similar path in terms of difficulty and themes, but with different subjects or vocabulary.

On Duolingo I might be learning about cats eating birds or children reading, while on Rosetta Stone I'm learning about adults driving and teaching or children running and riding bicycles.

It also serves as my only real place for practicing pronunciation. I went into the settings and set recognition to the hardest level. It complains a lot more than Duolingo does, which is exactly what I want.

Lastly, the typing... this is a feature that I really like on the Rosetta Stone and the web version of Duolingo.

ANECDOTE
l'éléfant mange... le singe court... la fille a un vélo.... etc.

I've read the comments about useless vocab and examples because it gets you nowhere in a real conversation. Well... as part of my attempt to immerse myself in the language I listen to a French news channel that streams their content for free 24/7 on YouTube.

I type away during the day, while working, with this noise running in the background.

Once in a while I pick up a word or phrase. But a couple of nights ago, 'les éléphants mangent WHATEVER....WHATEVER WHATEVER les singes..." I'm like, "are they seriously talking about elephants and monkeys?" I look over, and sure enough, it was news report about how some elephants were running into a village and turning over trucks and eating and destroying a habitat where a bunch of small monkeys live, and that was pushing them into the village. The parting clip was an elephant picking up a bicycle and lifting it high above its head, on its trunk.

LOL, like all of these crazy one-off lessons, rolled up into a single news story.

VERDICT
Is Rosetta Stone helping me learn French? Yes. But it is my least used tool at the moment. And I've just ordered books so I have a feeling that I'll be using it a lot less.

I don't think it's worth $200.

19) For those struggling with the code, do a quick Google search on activing a code on Rosetta Stone. Add the same email you created your account with, and reload the site/app. It's an extra step, but it does work to give you access to 24 languages on one account, across any platform you choose.

I've seen some other reviews mentioning that it's hard to get into the language unless you have a basis- this is an IMMERSIVE learning program. They will never speak to you in your native language, and that's a good thing. That makes it easier for you to skip translating in your head. You see a picture of an apple, hear "manzana," and then choose an apple picture when you hear that word again. It's better for learning to skip the English (or your first language) and to associate that word with the concept directly.

So far, my only complaint is that I've learned some dialectal differences (I started at intermediate in one language) and sometimes it doesn't pick up my accent unless I enunciate in exactly the way it wants. I also wish it could slow down the sentences/word so that I could hear it properly- they speak clearly, but there is no way to get the program to "spell it out" unless the language you chose has an writing system you're perfect in.

20) Who hasn't heard of Rosetta Stone? I've always thought of them as the top brand for self-taught language courses. I don't think that now.

SUMMARY:
- Should not be primary, much less only tool
- Bad user experience online
- Useless phone app
- Decent speech recognition online
- Great for grammar
- Great practice typing (online version)
- Not sure that it's worth $200

FULL REVIEW
It's cool to think that you'll be able to learn 25 languages, but seriously.... You'll only have time to learn one well, at a time. And, at the slow pace that the lessons proceed, you'll spend 1 - 3 years learning the basics (vocab, grammar, etc).

But, one thing to take into account, is that this IS NOT for strict beginners. If you've never had a basic course in your target language, it will be hard to understand what to do, and how to respond.

This brings up a question of, "what is your end goal?"
- Are you looking to learn simple phrases you can use for an upcoming trip?
- Is this to supplement high school or college courses?
- Are you wanting to learn just enough to say a few phrases with friends or if you meet a native speaker?
- Or, are you like me, looking to become fluent?

I do agree in the "immersive" approach that Rosetta Stone takes. I, however, disagree with the way they implement it. No matter how much of an immersive experience, you usually have someone who can help explain any questions you might have.
- a child has adults
- when I got thrown into 3rd grade without knowing a word of English, there were kids my age patient enough to help me understand/learn/communicate

And that's something that this course is missing.

For these reasons, this should not be your primary tool for learning another language (slow pace, not for beginners, no help).

In addition, the web interface lacks functionality. Some lessons have a nice way to go back to lesson plan/path while others do not, forcing you to go back to 'Home'.

The phone app is notching more than flash cards. And the last straw was this morning when it sent me a message telling me to brush up on my Spanish (a language I've never even clicked on in app or site).

I find myself using Duolingo a lot more than Rosetta Stone. It encourages me because they've gamefied the experience but they've also done a fantastic job with their interface (online and on mobile).

Rosetta Stone's audio companion files have proven useless for me. The on-demand videos have some value in explaining local customs and slang, but not really all that useful. They should have turned these subjects into actual courses, instead.

WHAT DO I LIKE ABOUT ROSETTA STONE?
It complements Duolingo by navigating a similar path in terms of difficulty and themes, but with different subjects or vocabulary.

On Duolingo I might be learning about cats eating birds or children reading, while on Rosetta Stone I'm learning about adults driving and teaching or children running and riding bicycles.

It also serves as my only real place for practicing pronunciation. I went into the settings and set recognition to the hardest level. It complains a lot more than Duolingo does, which is exactly what I want.

Lastly, the typing... this is a feature that I really like on the Rosetta Stone and the web version of Duolingo.

ANECDOTE
l'éléfant mange... le singe court... la fille a un vélo.... etc.

I've read the comments about useless vocab and examples because it gets you nowhere in a real conversation. Well... as part of my attempt to immerse myself in the language I listen to a French news channel that streams their content for free 24/7 on YouTube.

I type away during the day, while working, with this noise running in the background.

Once in a while I pick up a word or phrase. But a couple of nights ago, 'les éléphants mangent WHATEVER....WHATEVER WHATEVER les singes..." I'm like, "are they seriously talking about elephants and monkeys?" I look over, and sure enough, it was news report about how some elephants were running into a village and turning over trucks and eating and destroying a habitat where a bunch of small monkeys live, and that was pushing them into the village. The parting clip was an elephant picking up a bicycle and lifting it high above its head, on its trunk.

LOL, like all of these crazy one-off lessons, rolled up into a single news story.

VERDICT
Is Rosetta Stone helping me learn French? Yes. But it is my least used tool at the moment. And I've just ordered books so I have a feeling that I'll be using it a lot less.

I don't think it's worth $200.
